# Base Verify Documentation

Base Verify allows users to prove ownership of verified accounts (X, Coinbase, Instagram, TikTok) without sharing credentials. Your app receives a deterministic token for Sybil resistance.

> **Note:** Base Verify does not perform abuse detection; responsibility lies entirely with integrators.

**How it works:**
1. Check if wallet has verification → API returns yes/no
2. If no → redirect to Base Verify Mini App for OAuth
3. User verifies → returns to your app
4. Check again → now verified
